# CricketFarmProject

This project was my semester project during a semester abroad at VIA Horsens.
The overall concept was to develop an automated cricket farm. The users would throw their food leftovers in the system which would feed crickets, which in turn would be food for the users, or their pets.
The system was built in cooperation with a mechanical engineering student, and was controlled using an Arduino and an Android application communicating through Firebase.

This repository contains the code  of the Android application, build with Android Studio.
